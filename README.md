# mma7660fc

A platform agnostic driver to interface with the MMA7660FC 3-Axis Accelerometer via I2C

This chip can be found on Seeed's Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer(Â±1.5g)

This driver was built using [`embedded-hal`] traits.

[`embedded-hal`]: https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/~0.1

## What works

- Read the XOUT register for value of x
- Read registers XOUT, YOUT and ZOUT to get  6-bits output value for x, y and z
- Set mode to active or standby

## TODO

- [ ] Allow to modify sampling rate, currently initialised to 4 samples per second active
- [ ] Get other data such as orientation, tilt, etc
- [ ] Test with stm32f30x-hal, currently only testing with linux-embedded-hal
